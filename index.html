        follows Emma, an actress struggling with addiction, as she enters rehab
        after a public breakdown. Resistant to the recovery process, she
        challenges the program’s principles while grappling with her identity
        and the truth about herself. The play explores the chaos of addiction,
        the difficulty of confronting one’s inner demons, and the nonlinear path
        of recovery. Through vivid and disorienting staging, the audience
        experiences Emma’s distorted reality as she fights to reclaim control
        over her life.

          >Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? by Edward Albee</span
        >
        is a dark and intense drama that follows George and Martha, a
        middle-aged married couple, as they invite a younger couple, Nick and
        Honey, to their home after a college faculty party. Over the course of a
        long, alcohol-fueled night, the couples engage in a series of brutal,
        emotionally charged games that expose lies, secrets, and deep-seated
        frustrations. George and Martha’s volatile relationship takes center
        stage as their arguments escalate, revealing a tragic, invented
        narrative about their “son.” The younger couple becomes entangled in the
        chaos, with Nick and Honey’s own vulnerabilities and marital issues
        coming to light. By the end of the night, the truth is laid bare,
        leaving all four characters emotionally shattered and forever changed.
        The play is a raw exploration of truth, illusion, love, and the
        destructive power of repressed pain.

        <span class="play">The Good Place by Michael Schur</span> is a smart and
        heartwarming comedy that follows Eleanor Shellstrop, who wakes up in a
        utopia designed for people who led exceptionally good lives on Earth.
        However, Eleanor quickly realizes there’s been a mistake—she doesn’t
        belong there, as her life was far from virtuous. To avoid being found
        out, she turns to Chidi, a kind-hearted ethics professor, to teach her
        how to be a better person. Alongside new friends Tahani, a glamorous
        socialite, and Jason, a well-meaning but clueless DJ, Eleanor works to
        fit in while grappling with the challenges of the afterlife. Together,
        they discover unexpected truths about themselves, the meaning of
        goodness, and what it takes to truly live an ethical life.
